# TODO
## 1

* scratchpad potom "veci na cestu"
ASSERT failure in QList<T>::operator[]: "index out of range", file ../Qt/5.5/gcc_64/include/QtCore/qlist.h, line 518
fish: “./NixNote-2.1.0-alfa8-x86_64.Ap…” terminated by signal SIGABRT (Abort)

* Change "Message Log" for info box with paths
* Modify ini file groups for v2.1
* Docker build with ubuntu 14.04 (to support older systems)
* Better statusbar display on exceptions
* Add release notes dialog
* Improve html cleanup (in case of further sync problems)
* Add "simplify html"  
* Update to Qt 5.11 
* Copying images from to note/note seems to destroy the note
* Refresh translation files
* Send email using external email client
* PDF export
    * Pdf export someway takes the background theme color as background for PDF
    * It seems PDF export file picker stays in background after first PDF export.. then stays hidden=>confusing
    * Filedialog should add pdf extension
    * Default FN - note title?
    * OK dialog is useless

## 2
* Improve search 
* Automatic search after typing text in search box (search box "onchange" => search)
* Optional removal of diacritics before search and index - currently mixing words with 
  diacritics and without doesn't work at all 
* Improve display with thumbnails
