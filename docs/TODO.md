# TODO / Roadmap
## 1
* fix eu date formats (mm.dd => dd.mm)
* for some reason dirty flag on simplify doesn't really work => fix
* Check why some new notes land in "Conflict"
  * seems to happen, when new note is created and edited more than one time before sync 
* Better status bar display on exceptions (shortcuts / 2 part status bar)
* Check relevance evaluation in connection with diacritic removal 
* PDF export
    * Default FN - note title?
    * Maybe open the PDF after export
* Refresh translation files

## 2
* Send email using external email client
* Automatic search after typing text in search box (search box "onchange" => search)
* Improve display with thumbnails
* Copying images from to note/note seems to destroy the note
