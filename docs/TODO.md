# TODO / Roadmap
## 1
* Check why some new notes land in "Conflict"
  * seems to happen, when new note is creates and edited more than one time before sync 
* Better statusbar display on exceptions (shortcuts / 2 part status bar)
* Check relevance evaluation in connection with diacritic removal 
* PDF export
    * It seems PDF export file picker stays in background after first PDF export.. then stays hidden=>confusing
    * Filedialog should add pdf extension
    * Default FN - note title?
    * OK dialog is useless
* Refresh translation files

## 2
* Send email using external email client
* Automatic search after typing text in search box (search box "onchange" => search)
* Improve display with thumbnails
* Copying images from to note/note seems to destroy the note
