# TODO
## 1
* Save/restore colors to/from state
* Reset table view position to top after search
* Clear search term after clicking on all notes
* Send email using external email client
* Improve info related to sync error - e.g. "Unable to update note.  Invalid note 
  structure"


## 2
* Improve status info when sync and/or indexing is running (as it sometimes makes app unusable)
* Improve search (~title search should not do automatic right truncation)
* Automatic search after typing text in search box (search box "onchange" => search)
* AppImage build
