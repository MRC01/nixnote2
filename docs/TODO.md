# TODO / Roadmap
## 1
* Improve html cleanup 
* Better statusbar display on exceptions (shortcuts / 2 part status bar)
* ~Remove autohide option, remove pdfinline-option
* Improve "simplify html" (images/medias)  
* Copying images from to note/note seems to destroy the note
* Refresh translation files
* PDF export
    * Pdf export someway takes the background theme color as background for PDF
    * It seems PDF export file picker stays in background after first PDF export.. then stays hidden=>confusing
    * Filedialog should add pdf extension
    * Default FN - note title?
    * OK dialog is useless

## 2
* Send email using external email client
* Improve search 
* Automatic search after typing text in search box (search box "onchange" => search)
* Optional removal of diacritics before search and index - currently mixing words with 
  diacritics and without doesn't work at all 
* Improve display with thumbnails
* Maybe: docker build with ubuntu 14.04 (to support older systems)
