NixNote2 sources for Debian
---------------------------

The bundled qevercloud library is removed in Debian. This library is
packaged separately.

The purple-theme files in images/purple-theme/* are removed due to unclear
copyright status. Upstream did not give a clear statement about its license,
only the name of the author is provided. As a result, the purple theme
will not be available. Please use the default theme.
